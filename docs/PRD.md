# HungryFools.dev — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🎯 Overview

HungryFools.dev is a directory of AI‑first "vibecoder" developers who build fast. The product enables:

- Developers to sign in with GitHub and publish rich profiles (skills/stack, interests, projects, availability).
- Other developers to discover and contact collaborators through intelligent search.
- Premium features for enhanced visibility (future monetization).

Primary users: AI‑first developers; Secondary users: hiring managers/companies.

## 🎯 Current Status: Intelligent Search ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Intelligent hybrid search that handles natural language queries like "mastra.ai developers in Germany who also like music"

The hybrid search system is now live and operational, combining BM25 keyword matching, vector similarity search, and BGE reranking.

### ✅ Implemented Search Architecture

1. **✅ LLM Query Intelligence**: Parses natural language to extract entities (companies, locations, skills, interests)
2. **✅ Multi-Modal Search**:
   - BM25 keyword matching (wink-nlp)
   - Vector similarity search (BGE-M3 embeddings via pgvector)
   - SQL filters for structured data
3. **✅ BGE Reranking**: Final result ordering using Cloudflare's BGE reranker
4. **✅ Performance Optimization**: Parallel search execution with timing analytics

### ✅ Implemented Technical Stack

- **✅ Embeddings**: BGE-M3 (1024 dimensions) via Cloudflare Workers AI
- **✅ Vector Storage**: pgvector extension on Neon with HNSW indexing
- **✅ BM25**: wink-nlp library for fast keyword matching
- **✅ Test Data**: Scripts for generating realistic test profiles
- **✅ Analytics**: Search timing and performance tracking

## 📋 Current Development Priorities

### Next Priorities

1. **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve search interface with filters, facets, and result previews
2. **Search Analytics**: Complete PostHog instrumentation for search queries and CTR
3. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, query optimization, and response time improvements
4. **Company Features**: Enhanced company directory and hiring tools

### Future Monetization (Later)
