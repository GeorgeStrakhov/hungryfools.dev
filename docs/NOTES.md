- how to best do hybrid search? BM25 + our vector + rerank?

- search the projects, not just profile?

- display link to the user's github

- why User as displayed name

- edit profile - make it nicer

- checkbox to allow / disallow being introduced

- when to calculate embeddings on the profile and projects? (end of onboarding, any edit)

- nicer directory view. show projects with opensource (githubUrl)

- one more pass at analytics

- companies listing / hiring board / job board

- dynamic from the DB (add in the admin)

- LATER: stripe integration to add sponsored links and jobs

- separate page for the directory of projects. isOpenSource (github code link add to the schema)
