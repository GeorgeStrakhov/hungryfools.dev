- how to best do hybrid search? BM25 + our vector + rerank?

- search the projects, not just profile?

- display link to the user's github

- send something to the user (including llm analysis of both your profiles and possible similarity areas). like make an intro button.

- edit profile - make it nicer

- when to calculate embeddings on the profile and projects? (end of onboarding, any edit)

- nicer directory view

- one more pass at analytics

- onboarding - better options for questions

- companies listing / hiring board / job board

- fixed listing + dynamic from the DB

- stripe!! - subscribe / unsubscribe (unsubscribe removes the page)

- separate page for the directory of projects. isOpenSource (github code link add to the schema)
