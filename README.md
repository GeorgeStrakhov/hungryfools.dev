# HungryFools.dev

_a directory of hungry and foolish vibecoders who ship human-level stuff at superhuman speed_

This is a simple lil' website where AI-first developers can list themselves, find each other for collaborations and get hired.

- Developers who are not afraid of being called vibecoders can login with github and list their profile, their preferred tech/stack and other skills, their fav. projects and what they are interested in and maybe location - and whether they are open for hire, open for collabs, or hiring etc.

- Other developers can search and find and contact potential collaborators

- for a small fee companies can list themselves as vibecoder-friendly and say they are hiring.

- for good search - we build embeddings of the profiles and projects and have a hybrid search (both keywords and vector similarity, reranking, smart filters)
